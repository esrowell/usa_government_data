# This data is loaded directly into bigquery.  All data was loaded as strings for simplicity,
#  data gets converted to the appropriate type on use.
# Data is overly normalized with a column for each year for each budget line item.
#   We denormalize the data using a large union statement to to build a line_item_year table.
# We then convert then build a budget_year_facts table so we can compute each line item
#  as a percentage of the entire years budget.
